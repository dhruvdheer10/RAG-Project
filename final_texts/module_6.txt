Queue Management
Queue management can be done by one or more people. It can be a shared responsibility across a team, or a single person.
Managers and directors should decide how best to ensure that their queues and tickets are managed and monitored.
A "group manager" role is applied to each Assingment Group, notating the person accountable for the queue management for that group.
Once tickets are assigned to an inidividual, that person is responsible for managing and monitoring their own work queue.
