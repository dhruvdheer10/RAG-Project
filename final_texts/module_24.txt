DELETING REQUEST TICKETS:

As Request tickets can not be further converted, open a new tab and go directly to ServiceNow Ticket Deletion Request form at ServiceNow Ticket Deletion Form
Note: Add your name to the Requested for field on the ServiceNow Ticket Deletion form. 
Open SNOW in a new tab in the browser and select All - Service Desk - Catalog. Search the corresponding catalog form to create a new REQ ticket (If a new REQ ticket needs to be created).
Fill out the form by replicating the details entered in the original request. (Redact or delete any personal identifiers that may have been included in the original request).
RITM or TASK type tickets are children of a REQ and cannot be directly deleted.
Fill out the rest of the ServiceNow Ticket Deletion form (Add your name to the Requested for field).
Select the ticket type and add the ticket number to be deleted.
Enter a Replacement ticket number (if exists).
Add any related ticket numbers (INCD, IMS, RITM and TASK) in the reason for deletion box as well as reason for deletion.
