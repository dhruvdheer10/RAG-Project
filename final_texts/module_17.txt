How to use the Incident cause and close codes

Cause codes tells ITS what potentially caused the service interruption or performance degradation. Close codes let us know the status of the incident after it is resolved. Both codes are helpful in after-action efforts like root cause analysis. Problem Management is aimed at minimizing the recurrence of the same incident by addressing the root causes. Close and cause codes are required when resolving an incident.

 
Step 1: Resolve the incident
 
Step 2: Select the close code

4. Issue Not reproducible

Note: There is a close code for Cancelled but this code cannot be chosen manually, instead it is auto-applied if the ticket is cancelled
